EMail Marketing Analysis using PowerBI

  - This project is based upon the dataset that is taken from the list of the subscribers for the email newsletters and it can be used for analysis for email marketing purposes.
  - The dataset has around 10,000 records and it contain varied information patterns and constraints like physical features, location, the status of the individuals who have subscribed for the email newsletters.
  - Depending on this, we will analyze the whole dataset and try to visualize a report to find out the target age, the target category, the target residence location of the individuals who are most likely to subscribe to the email newsletter.
  
  The steps I followed in this project are : 
  
    1. Cleaning the Data such as removing inconsistencies (null values), renaming columns names, formatting data, removing unnecessary columns which are not required for our analysis.
    2. Created Visualizations such as Donut Chart, Stacked Column and Bar Charts, Waterfall Chart and KPI (Key Performance Indicator) Cards to visualize the insights we found from the data.
    3. Publish the report to PowerBI Service to share it to people online.
